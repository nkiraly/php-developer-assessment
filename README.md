Web Developer Assessment
=======================================

The task is to developer a simple web application which users can sign into with their Twitter account. The user's Twitter access credentials and any additional information you deem necessary should be persisted to the database.
When authenticated, the user should be able to access the URL '/profile' and see details of their Twitter user profile including name and bio. It should also display the user's current Twitter avatar and include a link to their actual Twitter profile.

This repository includes an out of the box Symfony Standard 2.1.7 codebase, but feel free to user the Silex micro framework, Zend Framework 2, or even build from scratch.
We recommend you make use of the kertz/twitteroauth (https://github.com/kertz/twitteroauth) or abraham/twitteroauth (https://github.com/abraham/twitteroauth) Twitter API PHP libraries.

Try to demonstrate a knowledge of object-oriented concepts and domain-driven design (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) in your solution.

### Additional Information

1. Please fork this repository before you start the assessment.

3. You will need to provide your own Twitter and Facebook apps for authentication.

Good luck!
